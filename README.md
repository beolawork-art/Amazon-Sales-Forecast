# Amazon-Sales-Forecast

### 🎯 What is this project about?
I used three different tools to help Amazon understand its sales:
1. **SQL**: To clean up the data and find the best sellers.
2. **Python**: To predict how much money they will make next week.
3. **Power BI**: To build a dashboard that shows where they are losing money.

### 💡 Key Discoveries
* **The Best Product:** "Sets" make the most money!
* **The Riskiest Product:** "Western Dresses" are returned almost 10% of the time.
* **Future Sales:** My Python model predicts sales will stay strong next month!

### 🛠️ What's inside this folder?
* `analysis.py`: My Python code for forecasting.
* `queries.sql`: The SQL code used to find sales trends.
* `dashboard.pbix`: My interactive Power BI charts.
